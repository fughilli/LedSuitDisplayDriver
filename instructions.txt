First, connect bluetooth:

bluetoothctl
# connect <Bluetooth Audio Source MAC>
# exit

Then, start the audio loopback:
pactl load-module module-loopback source="bluez_source.<Bluetooth Audio Source MAC>.a2dp_source" sink="alsa_output.platform-soc_sound.analog-stereo"

Then, run the ProjectM instance:
sudo ./run_projectm.sh

Wait for the instance to start. The display driver will be started by that script as well.


# DEBUGGING

To debug the strip driver, first start an X server:
sudo xinit -- :0

Then, start the strip driver:
./led_driver[_test] &

Finally, run the watch script which displays images:
./display_image.sh [image file]

This will run ImageMagick `display' in update mode. Any changes to the image file will be reflected to the strip within a couple of seconds.

Use the `send_test_image.sh' script to watch a local image file and send it to the display driver for testing. You can re-export a test image from Gimp using <Ctrl>-E

# CONFIGURING INPUT SOURCE
